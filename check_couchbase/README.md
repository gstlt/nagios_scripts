## check_couchbase

There are two checks implemented in this script: 
* Check if Couchbase status is ok (memory, disk usage and if nodes are balanced)
* Check if Couchbase buckets memory and disk usage is not approaching quota

For details see ./check_couchbase -h 

More documentation will get here soon enough.
